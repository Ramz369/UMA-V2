- **Intelligent relationship detection** - Understands imports, calls, data flows
- **Semantic understanding** - Uses AI to comprehend component purposes

### üìç Fingerprint System
- Every file gets a unique semantic fingerprint
- Tracks intent, purpose, and relationships
- Version history and evolution tracking
- Automatic metadata injection

### üé® 3D Interactive Visualization
- Real-time architecture rendering
- Multiple visualization layers (structure, data flow, dependencies)
- Time-travel through git history
- Interactive debugging and exploration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Intelligent Warnings
- Architectural violations
- Circular dependencies
- Orphaned code
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone or navigate to your project with CogniMap
cd your-project/cognimap

# Install JavaScript dependencies for visualization
npm install

# Build the visualization bundle
npm run build

# Generate the architecture graph
python3 cli.py visualize
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Architecture Graph

```bash
# Use the interactive launcher
./visualize.sh

# Or run directly
python3 cli.py visualize
```

This will:
- Scan all project files
- Extract semantic fingerprints
- Build the architecture graph
- Generate visualization data

### 2. View Your Architecture

```bash
# Option 1: Open the InfraNodus-style interactive visualization
open visualizer/interactive.html

# Option 2: Use the launcher menu
./visualize.sh
# Then select option 2 (Open Dashboard)

# Option 3: Serve via HTTP
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/visualizer/interactive.html
```

### 3. Explore Your Architecture

**Interactive Visualization Features:**
- **ForceAtlas2 Layout**: InfraNodus-style network visualization
- **Real-time Search**: Filter nodes by name or type
- **Component Details**: Click nodes to see relationships
- **Multiple Layouts**: Switch between ForceAtlas2, hierarchical, circular
- **Statistics**: View node/edge counts and component types

**Command Line Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze architecture for issues
python3 cli.py analyze

# Export to different formats
python3 cli.py export --format mermaid
python3 cli.py export --format json
```

## Integration

CogniMap integrates with:
- **Git**: Automatic tracking on commits
- **CI/CD**: Architecture validation in pipelines
- **IDEs**: VS Code, IntelliJ extensions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated architecture docs

## Advanced Features

### Semantic Layers
Switch between different views of your architecture:
- **Code Structure**: Files and functions
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Control Flow**: Execution paths
- **Intent Layer**: What each component is trying to achieve
- **Dependency Layer**: What depends on what

### Time Travel
Slide through your project's history and watch the architecture evolve:
- See when components were added
- Track relationship changes
- Identify breaking points
- Understand evolution patterns

### AI-Powered Insights
CogniMap uses LLMs to provide intelligent insights:
- Component purpose explanation
- Improvement suggestions
- Anti-pattern detection
- Refactoring recommendations

## DeepSeek Scenario Reports

CogniMap can leverage the [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com) API to identify core
architectural elements and highlight gaps in the current implementation. Run:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key
python scripts/deepseek_scenario_report.py
```

The generated proposal will be written to
`reports/cognimap/deepseek_scenario_report.md` so downstream agents can reason
over the architecture and fill in missing links.

## Semantic Analysis Engine

To build a symbol-based understanding of the codebase and surface potential
architecture gaps run the semantic analyzer:

```bash
python -m cognimap.semantic_engine.semantic_analyzer
```

This produces machine-readable reports under `reports/cognimap/semantic/`
including:

- `symbol_graph.json` ‚Äì all discovered symbols and references
- `semantic_gaps.json` ‚Äì components that share semantics but are not
  connected
- `pattern_analysis.json` ‚Äì detected design pattern markers
- `improvement_roadmap.md` ‚Äì placeholder for AI generated suggestions

These outputs also seed persistent memory files used by future agents to
incrementally grow CogniMap's semantic understanding.
