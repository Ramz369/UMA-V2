# TRUTH.md - Actual vs Claimed Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: August 7, 2025 Evening (Session 2)

## üî¥ Critical Finding
**The original HANDOVER.md contained 6 false PR descriptions that do not match git history.**

This document provides the verified truth about what exists vs what was claimed.

---

## ‚úÖ What Actually Exists (Verified by Testing)

### Evolution Engine (FULLY IMPLEMENTED)
```bash
# Test passed: python3 evolution/test_integration.py
```
- ‚úÖ 5 Python agents in `/evolution/agents/`:
  - External Auditor (`auditor.py`)
  - Discussion Agent (`reviewer.py`)
  - Architect Agent (`architect.py`)
  - Implementor Agent (`implementor.py`)
  - Treasurer Agent (`treasurer.py`)
- ‚úÖ Kafka integration with mock mode
- ‚úÖ $500 seed funding configured
- ‚úÖ 50-day runway tracking
- ‚úÖ Complete isolation architecture

### Credit Management
```bash
# Test passed: python3 tools/credit_sentinel_v2.py metrics
```
- ‚úÖ Credit Sentinel v2 with checkpoint functionality
- ‚úÖ Checkpoints created every 50 credits (verified)
- ‚úÖ Real-time throttling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CSV logging (performance bottleneck)

### Session Management
```bash
# Test passed: python3 tools/session_summarizer.py
```
- ‚úÖ YAML summary generation
- ‚úÖ Context hashing
- ‚úÖ Git state tracking

### Memory Hygiene
```bash
# Test passed: Garbage flag filters 1 event in PILOT-001
```
- ‚úÖ Garbage flag in event schema
- ‚úÖ Embedder filters garbage events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Embedder uses placeholder vectors (line 72)

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Docker compose stack configured
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, MinIO setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded credentials (minioadmin)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not deployed, mock mode only

## ‚ùå What Does NOT Exist (Despite Claims)

### Core UMA-V2 Agents (UPDATED)
**2 of 6 core agents now implemented in Session 2:**
```bash
# Progress: 33% of core agents complete
```
- ‚úÖ **Planner Agent** - `/agents/planner_agent.py` (429 lines) PR #15
- ‚úÖ **Codegen Agent** - `/agents/codegen_agent.py` (731 lines) PR #16
- ‚ùå Backend Tester - No implementation yet
- ‚ùå Frontend Tester - No implementation yet
- ‚ùå Stress Tester - `/agents/stress-tester.md` (spec only)
- ‚ùå Integration Agent - `/agents/integration-agent.md` (spec only)

### Claimed but Missing Systems

#### "Checkpoint-Recovery System" (PR #11)
- **Claimed**: Standalone checkpoint-recovery system
- **Reality**: PR #11 was "Stack Hardening" - configuration fixes
- **What exists**: Only Credit Sentinel has checkpoint functionality

#### "Memory & Immune System" (PR #10)
- **Claimed**: Immune system with anomaly detection
- **Reality**: PR #10 was "SemLoop Docker Stack" - infrastructure
- **What exists**: Only garbage flag filtering (basic)

#### "Document Preprocessing" (PR #6)
- **Claimed**: Document processing pipeline
- **Reality**: PR #6 was Integration Agent markdown spec
- **What exists**: Nothing

#### "Batch Processing" (PRs #8-9)
- **Claimed**: Batch generation and processing
- **Reality**: PR #8 was docs, PR #9 was meta-analyst
- **What exists**: Nothing

## üéØ Real State of the System

### Production Readiness: 50% (Updated)
- Evolution Engine: Complete but dormant
- Infrastructure: Configured but not deployed  
- Core functionality: 33% complete (2/6 agents)
- Embeddings: ‚úÖ FIXED (real implementations)

### Development Readiness: 70%
- Mock mode: Fully functional
- Tests: Pass successfully
- Evolution: Ready to activate
- Session management: Working

### Critical Blockers for Production (UPDATED)
1. ~~**No core agents**~~ - ‚úÖ 2/6 implemented, 4 remaining
2. ~~**Placeholder embeddings**~~ - ‚úÖ FIXED in PR #17
3. **Mock Kafka only** - No distributed messaging
4. **Hardcoded credentials** - Security risk
5. **No UI** - No user interface
6. **Missing test agents** - Backend/Frontend testers needed

---

## üö® Priority Actions (Based on Reality)

### Week 1: Core Implementation (UPDATED)
1. ‚úÖ Implement Planner Agent in Python - DONE (PR #15)
2. ‚úÖ Implement Codegen Agent in Python - DONE (PR #16)
3. ‚úÖ Wire real embeddings - DONE (PR #17)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix hardcoded credentials - Still needed
5. ‚úÖ Correct all documentation - DONE

### Week 2: Complete Core System
1. Implement tester agents
2. Replace CSV with event streaming
3. Install aiokafka for real Kafka
4. Deploy Docker infrastructure
5. Start UI scaffold

### Week 3+: Production Path
1. Activate Evolution Engine
2. Complete UI development
3. Add monitoring (Prometheus)
4. Security audit
5. Load testing

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify claims against code**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline  # Check actual PR history
   find . -name "*.py" | grep agent  # Find real implementations
   python3 <file>  # Test if it actually works
   ```

2. **Documentation drift is dangerous**
   - 6 PRs were completely misdocumented
   - Claims of systems that don't exist
   - Could mislead future development

3. **Evolution Engine is the only complete subsystem**
   - 5 agents fully implemented
   - Tested and working
   - Ready for activation

4. **Core UMA-V2 doesn't exist yet**
   - Only markdown specifications
   - No Python implementations
   - This is the #1 priority
