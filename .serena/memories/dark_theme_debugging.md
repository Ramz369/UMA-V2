# Dark Theme Implementation Issue

## Status: UNRESOLVED
Date: 2025-01-08

## What Was Attempted:
1. Implemented CSS variables system for dark theme
2. Replaced all hardcoded colors with CSS variables
3. Converted HSL syntax to hex for browser compatibility
4. Verified no JavaScript is overriding styles

## Current State:
- File: cognimap/visualizer/interactive.html
- CSS variables defined in :root
- All colors using var() references
- Hex colors: #0a0a0a (background), #fafafa (text), #8b5cf6 (purple accent)

## Issue:
Dark theme not displaying - page still shows old theme despite code changes

## Possible Causes to Investigate:
1. Browser cache (tried hard refresh, didn't work)
2. Server cache (tried new ports 8081, 8082)
3. CSS specificity issues
4. JavaScript dynamically setting styles
5. Browser not supporting CSS variables
6. Something overriding the :root variables

## Files Involved:
- cognimap/visualizer/interactive.html (main file)
- cognimap/visualizer/dist/bundle.js (webpack bundle)
- cognimap/visualizer/output/architecture_graph.json (data)

## Next Steps:
1. Check browser console for CSS errors
2. Verify CSS variables in computed styles
3. Test in different browser
4. Check if bundle.js contains style overrides
5. Try inline styles as test
6. Verify server is serving latest file

## Test URLs:
